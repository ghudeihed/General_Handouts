# Useful Links
This directory contains child directories for XCS classes, within each of these directories there is a document containing links to further resources. We categorise resources as follows:

* Research Papers ([example](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.04617))
* Code ([example](https://github.com/suraj-nair-1/lorel))
* Blog Posts ([example](https://ai.stanford.edu/blog/meta-exploration/))
* Talks/Presentations ([example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=733m6qBH-jI))
* Podcasts ([example](https://www.eye-on.ai/podcast-044))

The purpose of including these links is to help students navigate some of the related materials that are openly available online and to instigate additional discussion around the class materials. We hope you find value in exploring the available links.
