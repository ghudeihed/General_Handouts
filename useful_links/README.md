# Useful Links
This directory contains a child directory for XCS classes, within each of these child directories there is a README.md file containing links to further resources. We categorise resources as follows:

* Research Papers ([example](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.04617))
* Code ([example](https://github.com/suraj-nair-1/lorel))
* Blog Posts ([example](https://ai.stanford.edu/blog/meta-exploration/))
* Talks/Presentations ([example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=733m6qBH-jI))
* Podcasts ([example](https://www.eye-on.ai/podcast-044))

The purpose of including these links is to help students navigate some of the materials that relate to the class content which are available online and to instigate additional discussion. We hope you find value in exploring the available links.
